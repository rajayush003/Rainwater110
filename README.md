                <h1><u>What is Rainwater Harvesting?</u></h1>
                <p style="display: inline;">Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) is the collection and storage of rain, rather
                    than
                    allowing it to run off.
                    Rainwater is collected from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit (well,
                    shaft, or
                    borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation, so that it seeps down and restores the ground
                    water.<br>
                    <br>
                    Rainwater harvesting is one of the simplest and oldest methods of self-supply of water for
                    households,
                    having been used in South Asia and other countries for many thousands of years.<br>
                    Installations can be designed for different scales including households, neighbourhoods and
                    communities and
                    can also be designed to serve institutions such as schools, hospitals and other public facilities.

                <h2>1.Storing harvested water for future use.</h2>
                <p>In this method, rainwater flows away as surface runoff and can be stored for future use. Surface
                    water
                    can be
                    stored by diverting the flow of small creeks and streams into reservoirs on the surface or
                    underground.<br>
                    It can provide water for farming, for cattle and also for general domestic use. Surface runoff
                    harvesting is
                    most suitable in urban areas.</p>

                            the silt trap, which allows for silt to settle down in the chamber</td>

                <p>Rainwater harvesting is a centuries-old technique that has recently been finding favor in many
                    countries
                    worldwide as an efficient, sustainable way to provide clean drinking water and irrigate crops. This
                    cost
                    effective technology is becoming increasingly popular for its many advantages like replenishing
                    rapidly
                    depleting groundwater reserves, reducing strain</p>
                <p>Many Countries are using RHW system to fulfill their water demand from decades using modern
                    techniques
                    and
                    equipments like <b>China, Thailand, USA, Canada,India </b></a>modern technology</p>
